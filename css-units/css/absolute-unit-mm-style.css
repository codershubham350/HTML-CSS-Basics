/* In CSS there are two types of units
1) Absolute units(fixed units) :- px, pt, cm, mm, in, pc, etc.
2) Relative units :- em, rem, %, ex, ch. vw, vh, vmin/vmax, etc. */

/*Milimeter(mm) is used when the content is to be displayed
on any printing media platform, as the length size expressed
with this unit is very precise and accurate*/

       = 0.1 cm
       = 3.78 px

/*Note:- The "mm" unit is not recommended to be used for
displaying contents on screen, as the screen sizes may vary
which results in the content not getting displayed properly.*/
