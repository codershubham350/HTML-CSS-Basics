        The concept of a font stack comes from early in the 
        web, when there were only a few trustworthy fonts 
        that one could installed on the majority of computers.
        It was often likely the font would not be available, 
        so the font stack provided an order of fonts that the 
        browser could attempt to find and load. In this section,
        you will learn the principles of a resilient font stack 
        and what options are available for fonts on modern devices.
        But first, you will create example HTML to demonstrate the fonts.
