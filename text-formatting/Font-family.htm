    <p>
        The font-family property specifies a list of fonts, 
        from highest priority to lowest. Font selection does 
        not stop at the
        first font in the list that is on the user's system. 
        Rather, font selection is done one character at a time,
        so that if an available font does not have a glyph for
        a needed character, the latter fonts are tried. When 
        a font is only available in some styles, variants, 
        or sizes, those properties may also influence which 
        font family is chosen.
