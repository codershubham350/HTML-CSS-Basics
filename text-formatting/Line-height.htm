    <h1>line-height property</h1>
    <p>
        When coding html pages for a website, the line spacing of the text content is probably one of attributes that is usually
        left as default. Most of the time, you do not even think about it and the default works the best in most browsers.
        
        The line spacing or line height is the vertical height between lines of text in a rendered html page. Almost always this
        spacing value is set to an appropriate value by the browser or the rendering engine. This value is usually dependent on
        the font of the rendered page, resolution of the page and several other factors.
        
        Having said that it rarely needs to be changed, once in a while you do run into situations where you would want to
        change this property. You might find that the font you are using creates either too little or too much line height by
        default. It might also be a special requirement, for example the lines needs to separated more than usual for emphasis.
        
        First of all, let us see what the default is that is used by most browsers. In most modern day browsers, the line
        spacing is usually set to either 110% or 120% of the pixel size or font size. This works great in almost all cases,
        making the text legible enough to be read.
